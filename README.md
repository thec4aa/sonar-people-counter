# C4AA Sonar People Counter

Designed for our collaboration with [Treatment Action Group](http://www.treatmentactiongroup.org/) for the 2018 AIDS Conference. [Learn more.](https://c4aa.org/2018/08/amsterdamcaa2018/)

This project uses sonar to detect when people walk through a doorway. The signal is sent to an arduino, which triggers lights (and possibly sounds) and counts the person on 8in LED numbers overhead.
